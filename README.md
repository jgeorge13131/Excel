# Excel - Model 1 Homework includes 1 Excel file and 1 Word file


Modify Existing Crowdfunding Excel file:

      Use Conditional formatting on 2 columns with different colors signify the campaign levels of acheivement
     
      Insert 4 columns to hold % funded, average donation, parent category, and sub category
      
      Insert 2 columns to hold new date format


Insert 4 pivot tables and graphs:

      (1) Show the Category in rows and Outcome counts in columns then depict the data in a bar graph.

      (2) Show the Sub-Category in rows and Outcome counts in columns then depict the data in a bar graph.

      (3) Show the Month in rows and Outcome counts in columns then depict the data in a line chart.  Create a Word document to answer the following 3 questions 

          What are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
          What are some limitations of this dataset?
          What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

      (4) Show the Month in rows and Outcome counts for successful, failed, and canceled campaigns follow by the percent of Total for each then depict the data in a line chart. 


Statisical Analysis:

      Create a table that shows 9 successful and failed campaigns along with the backers_count then calculate

          mean number of backers
          median number of backers
          minimum number of backers
          maximum number of backers
          variance of the number of backers
          standard deviation of the number of backers

      Determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.

      Determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns and explain why it is the correct answer.
